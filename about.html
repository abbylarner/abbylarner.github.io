    <h2>Hi There!</h2>
    <p>
    My name is Abby, and I'm a UI/UX Designer and Front-end Developer. I have experience working with companies large and small and I also enjoy being involved in the local design community! I've helped to organize local design events and even created a nation-wide event called Design Like Mad to bring together student and professional designers for a day of design and service.

    In my free time, I love exploring the outdoors and I'm involved in a variety of sports (ultimate frisbee, squash, and olympic weightifting to name a few). 
    </p>
    <p>
    I'd love to hear from you, so write me a note and I'll be a happy camper!
