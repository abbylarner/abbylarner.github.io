                <h1>Abby Larner: A Song Discovery</h1>
                <p>
                    I was tasked with figuring out a song that expresses me. I'm of the belief that who I am is reflected not only in my own opinions of my self but also the opinions of those I interact with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This song discovery project is my attempt to find a song that represents me by surveying people I interact with and choose a song that represents their views of me as well as my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I surveyed a group of 62 people that know me in a variety of capacities and for varying lengths of time. The average amount of time I have know one of the people I surveyed was 9 years and 9 months.  The least amount of time I have known a person is 2 months and the most is 27 years.
                </p>
                <p>Below you will find a summary of the data and my ultimate choice for a song that expresses me.

            <ul>
                <li><p>A pop song in the pop/rock category</p></li>

                <li><p>A song with a bpm of about 110 or close to the most represented bpm, 128 (a fast-paced, up-tempo song).</p></li>
                <li><p>A song with a mood that represents the most common mood throughout the selections.  A few are confident, cheerful, amiable, playful, energetic, exhuberant, lively, celebratory, strong, and light.</p></li>
