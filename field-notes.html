            <p>Frustration. That is the only word I can use to describe the past 3 years of trying to learn JavaScript. Sure, I can animate and plugin with jQuery ‘till the cows come home, but actually using JS to pull data from a database and create an app was a whole different pile of goo. </p>

            <p>I know I know, It’s super bowl Sunday. I should be baking delicious treats and getting ready to go watch the game (who’s playing again?). Instead, I’m on the precipice of a big move (new apartment, yay!) so instead I’ve decided to spend my Sunday playing with some fun CSS animations. </p>

            <p>It seems like recently I’ve been getting a lot of requests to grab coffee to chat about my job as a designer. Design, whether it’s visual or UX (user experience), is definitely an up and coming field. Most higher-ups are starting to realize that design has the amazing power to make or break a company’s success.</p>

            <p>First of all, I’m sorry for not posting in a while. The summers in Madison are prime time to take advantage of the weather, so I’ve had less time on my hands the past few months :) Not to mention another successful Design Like Mad MSN and a quickly approaching Design Like Mad PDX on October 25th!</p>

            <p>Anyone who knows me even remotely knows that I’m a HUGE Pixar fan. You also may know that I’m not the best at illustration, so in an attempt to improve my illustration skills and pay homage to my favorite animation company, I’ve decided to put my own spin on my favorite Pixar quotes in a free poster series!</p>
